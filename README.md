# Andrew is Wonderful

In order to properly celebrate Andrew's departure, it seems to me that we ought to provide a place for all the folks whose lives he has touched during his time at ecobee to tell him how great it's been to work with him.

Perhaps a powerpoint document of some kind would be a good venue for this!
